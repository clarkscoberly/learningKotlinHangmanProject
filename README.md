# Overview

{To further my learning I sat down and decided to learn Kotlin. I have seen Java before and have written a little in it and felt that it would stretch me out of comfort zone to learn something new and unique from my previous coding experiences.}

{In order to learn Kotlin I installed a JDK and then Intellij --kind of funny how the IDE people wrote their own language-- to allow for Kotlin to compile and work}

{My Purpose: To learn, grow, and eventually help other people as I continue my careear both personally and during my job.}
